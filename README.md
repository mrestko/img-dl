# img-dl

## Description

img-dl is a command line script for downloading albums.

    img-dl.py [-h] URL [PATH]

## Example

```bash
$ ./img-dl.py http://imgur.com/a/XbUFk
```

## ToDo

Currently there is basic support for Imgur including downloading of animated images as WebM format rather than extremely large gif files.

Longer term, I would like to expand to support other popular image hosts in the vein of youtube-dl.
